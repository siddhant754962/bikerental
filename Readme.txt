## Project Overview

This project forecasts **bike rental demand** for urban areas using **Random Forest Regression**, leveraging historical rental data and weather conditions. The model predicts rentals with high accuracy and the results can help in **resource allocation, planning, and urban mobility optimization**.

---

## Motivation

* Demonstrates **end-to-end machine learning skills**: data preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.
* Provides insights into **factors influencing bike rentals**, such as weather, day of the week, and holidays.
* Enhances CV with a **practical, real-world predictive model**.

## Dataset

* **Source:** [UCI Bike Sharing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset)
* **Contents:** Hourly/daily bike rentals with features including:

  * Date & time
  * Weather conditions: temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather situation
  * Holiday & working day indicators
  * Season
* **Target Variable:** `cnt` (total bike rentals)

---

## Problem Statement

Predict the total number of bike rentals for a given day/hour using relevant features.

**Use Cases:**

* Optimize bike distribution across stations
* Improve urban transportation planning
* Provide insights into **weather and seasonal impacts** on bike usage

## Model & Methodology

**Model:** Random Forest Regressor

* Handles numeric and categorical data efficiently
* Reduces overfitting via ensemble learning
* Provides **feature importance** insights

**Methodology:**

1. Data Cleaning & Missing Value Handling
2. Feature Engineering (Date to year/month/day, categorical encoding)
3. Data Splitting: Training & Test sets
4. Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning
5. Model Evaluation (RMSE, R¬≤ Score)
6. Model Deployment via Streamlit

---

## Implementation

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
import joblib

# Train model
rf_model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42, n_jobs=-1)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Save model
joblib.dump(rf_model, "bike_rental_rf_model.pkl")
```

* Data visualizations: rental trends, seasonality, correlation heatmaps
* Streamlit app for interactive predictions

---

## Application

* Input parameters: weather, date, season, holiday/working day
* Generates **predicted bike rental count** instantly
* Scenario analysis to explore **‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù conditions**
* Suitable for **urban planners, transportation services, and bike-sharing platforms**
